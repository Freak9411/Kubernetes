Q. Create a yaml file called nginx-deploy.yaml for a deployment of three replicas of nginx, listening on the container's port 80. 
They should have the labels role=webserver and app=nginx. The deployment should be named nginx-deploy.
Expose the deployment with a load balancer and use a curl statement on the IP address of the load balancer 
to export the output to a file titled output.txt.


Solution:

sudo kubectl run nginx-deploy --labels="role=webserver,app=nginx" --image=nginx --replicas=3 --port=80 -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml

### expose the deployment with a loadbalancer type, call it nginx-service

kubectl expose deployment nginx-deploy --type=LoadBalancer --name=nginx-service

### use a curl statement that connects to the IP endpoint of the nginx-service and save the output to a file called output.txt

curl IP > output.txt
